    In order to address the limitation of traditional sundials like Angbuilgu, which are calibrated for
    latitude-specific, a program for creating 3D-printable Angbuilgu was developed during the Joseon Dynasty. This
    initiative aimed to spread the exceptional value of Angbuilgu and make it accessible to a global audience. As a
    result, the accuracy of these 3D-printed Angbuilgu was significantly improved, ensuring that they could provide
    accurate timekeeping at various latitudes. Additionally, both online and offline learning materials were produced to
    enable people worldwide to appreciate the value of Angbuilgu and learn about its significance.
