<p class="lead">
    All celestial objects revolve around the Earth's equator in a circle once a day, centered on the Earth's axis. In order to project this daily motion onto the Siban through the Yeongchim shadow, the Yeongchim must always point to the North Celestial Pole. However, the North Celestial Pole changes as the angle between the Earth's equator and the horizon plane changes with latitude. For this reason, the position of the Jeolgiseon, including the position of the Yeongchim in the Angbuilgu, must also change with latitude. This is why you need an Angbuilgu specific to Busan if you go to Busan, and an Angbuilgu specific to Greenwich Observatory or Bangkok if you go there.
