<p class="lead">
    Did you print out an Angbuilgu and measure the time, but it was inaccurate? Why is that? It's because of the
    equation of time. The equation of time is the difference between mean solar time and apparent solar time. Mean solar
    time is the solar time when the ecliptic and the equator are parallel, and when the Earth's orbit is a perfect
    circle. However, in reality, the ecliptic and the equator are not parallel, and the Earth's orbit is an elliptical
    orbit, so there is a slight difference from mean solar time. This solar time is called apparent solar time, and the
    difference is called the equation of time. Even if you correct the equation of time, there will still be a slight
    difference between the time you can tell from your smartphone. This is because of the longitude difference. South
    Korea is located at 127 degrees east, but the standard time is based on 135 degrees east. The difference in time
    from this longitude difference must also be corrected. A difference of about 4 minutes occurs for every 1 degree of
    longitude difference.
