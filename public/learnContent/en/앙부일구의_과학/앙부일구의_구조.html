    The round bowl that makes up the Angbuilgu is called the Siban, which serves as the clock face. The Siban has Sigakseon and Jeogiseon drawn on it, so you can read the time and date by looking at the position of the shadow cast on the 시반.
    The Sigakseon are vertical lines that measure the time. The interval between Sigakseon is 15 minutes, and the central Sigakseon is noon. Based on this, the west is morning and the east is afternoon.
    The Jeolgiseon are horizontal lines that represent the Jeolgi, or dates. The Jeolgi at the top of the Jeolgiseon is Summer solstice, and the Jeolgi at the bottom of the Jeolgiseon is Winter solstice, so it can express all 24 Jeolgi. The interval between Jeolgiseon is not constant, unlike Sigakseon, because the ecliptic and the equator are not parallel.
    The Yeongchim plays the same role as the hour hand. It is arguably the most important structure in the Angbuilgu. You can check the time and date by looking at the Sigakseon and Jeolgiseon where the Yeongchim's shadow points.
    The Jipyeonghwan is a ring-shaped bowl with information about the time and date.
    Now that you understand the structure of the Angbuilgu, let's go and learn about its principle.
