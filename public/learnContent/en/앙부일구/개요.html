    Did you know that there is a sundial called 'Angbuilgu' in Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, in front of the statue of King Sejong? Angbuilgu was created during the time of King Sejong 600 years ago. It holds great scientific, historical, and cultural value and has been designated as Korean Treasure No. 845. However, if we were to move Angbuilgu from Gwanghwamun Square to Busan, would it still accurately measure time and date? What about if we took it outside of Korea to a foreign location? The answer is no. Angbuilgu's appearance and functionality would need to be adjusted to match the latitude of the new location. So, shall we now delve into more details about Angbuilgu?
