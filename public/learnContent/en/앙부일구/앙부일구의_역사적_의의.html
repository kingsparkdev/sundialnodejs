<p class="lead">
  Angbuilgu means a concave sundial that resembles a cauldron holding up the sky. The other sky that Angbuilgu holds up is the people. Angbuilgu is a sundial for the people. According to the Annals of King Sejong, Angbuilgu was first installed in front of Hyujeonggyo and Jongmyo. Hyujeonggyo and Jongmyo were busy thoroughfares in Hanyang (the historical name for Seoul) where many commoners passed by.

    The reason why the Angbuilgu was installed in this street was to enable as many people as possible to know the time. The reason for this can be more accurately understood by examining the inscription on the Angbuilgu.
    The inscription on the Angbuilgu reads:

          <p>"There is nothing greater than providing a clock."<br>"The 12 zodiac signs are drawn for the illiterate people."<br>"It was installed next to the road because people gather there."</p>

  In this way, the Angbuilgu is a clock that was made to help the people. It also helped the people's farming by directly showing the movement of the sun. Farming is very important to check the changes in the seasons and the weather, and therefore it is very important to know the solar movement, that is, the Jeolgi. The Angbuilgu, which expresses all 24 Jeolgi, is one of the easiest tools for people to know the solar terms. The Angbuilgu is, in the name of the people, a sundial that supports the sky.
